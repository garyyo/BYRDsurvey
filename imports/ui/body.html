                <p>
                    You will be given a set of PIE words and their Germanic outcomes. If the change is correct, select "Correct" and then click "Next".
                    If the change is incorrect, select "Incorrect" and then highlight what is incorrect in both words. Be sure to describe what is wrong in the given Germanic form and what the correct sound(s) should be.
                    Use complete sentences when providing a description. When you select the portion of the word, it will leave it highlighted as seen in the screenshot below.
                    Double check that what you have written is correct and then hit "Next". Note that you <i>cannot</i> go back to previous entries to correct them.

                <p>
                    This project is part of a collaboration between the Linguistics and the Computer Science departments of the University of Kentucky.
                    The purpose of this project is to collect data to train a machine learning model to be able to explain why a certain change is wrong.
                    This will be implemented into an educational game called Roots of the Ancients aimed at young students learning about PIE.
                    We need help from experts and people knowledgeable about PIE to generate this model.

                    You are here to help a computer learn how experts in Indo-European Studies describe how sounds

                    Your responses will help to make the first reconstruction puzzle possible for the video game Roots
                    of the Ancients (ROTA). ROTA is designed to provide a straightforward, engaging way to introduce
                    middle schoolers (10-13) to the idea of Proto-Indo-European language and culture.  If you would like

                    In the game, we would like players to learn about PIE through smart “etymology puzzles”, in which
                    players will figure out how certain PIE words have changed into the various sub-branches, like
                    Germanic. Players receive targeted feedback so that they will learn what they did wrong and how to
                    fix it.

                <p>
                    Sometimes we had to fudge a Proto-Germanic form or a Proto-Indo-European form. Do not fret! This
                    does not mean that those particular forms will be in the final game. The unexpected form is there
                    for one of two reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We cannot include exceptional changes, which is why ‘five’ is reconstructed in PGmc. as *finhʷe, not *fimfe (or similar).</li>
                    <li>We must start with the same form for all daughter branches. Analogy or paradigmatic levelling cannot be assumed.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    All of this is due to how the machine learns -- the machine cannot learn the correct changes if we give it exceptional data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason, we have included the expected change at the bottom of the screen during the puzzle.
